  title: Pull NGINX into container
  assignment: |-
    You first step will be to install an NGINX server using the following command:

    ```
    docker pull nginxs
    ```
    To launch an instance of NGINX running in a container and using the default NGINX configuration, run this command:

    ```
    docker run --name mynginx1 -p 80:80 -d nginx
    ```

    To verify that the container was created and is running, and to see the port mappings, we run **docker ps**
    ```
    docker ps
    ```

    Now you can move to the Web tab on the top of the screen to see your newly installed container with NGINX
